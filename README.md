I am quite into being a Dungeon Master (DM) for games of Dungeons & Dragons. As such, I come up with stories to tell my players.

One such upcoming story involves a group of people getting caught in the wrong place at the wrong time (to over-oversimplify), and they will need to rebuild a village from nothing.

This is a webapp written in Crystal and powered by [Amber Framework](https://amberframework.org/), which both myself and the players will be using to manage the building of the village in a much easier (I hope) way than reams of paper.
